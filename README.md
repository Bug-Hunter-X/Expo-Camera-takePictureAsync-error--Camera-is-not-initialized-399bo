## Expo Camera `takePictureAsync` Error: Camera Not Initialized

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API's `takePictureAsync` method. The error arises when the method is called before the camera has fully initialized.

### Problem

The `takePictureAsync` method is called prematurely, resulting in an error because the camera object is not yet ready.

### Solution

The solution involves adding a check to ensure that the camera is initialized before calling `takePictureAsync`.  This is done by verifying that the `cameraRef` object exists, has a `current` property, and the `current` property has a `type` property indicating the camera type.

### How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
5. Observe the error when you attempt to take a picture before the camera is fully initialized.  The fixed version demonstrates the correct usage.

### Additional Notes
This example uses React's `useEffect` hook to manage asynchronous camera initialization. Proper error handling ensures a smooth user experience even if the camera permission is not granted. The `takePicture` function will not execute unless the camera is ready. This prevents the common error and makes for more robust code.
